  bFrankFirstP : () => "Passage from Benjamin Franklin regarding his club JUNTO:\n\nI should have mentioned before that in the autumn of the preceding year [1727], I had form’d most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO.\n\nThe rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss’d by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing on any subject he pleased.

[namely], twelve. We had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was pretty well observ’d; the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find it difficult to refuse. I was one of those who were against any addition to our number, but, instead of it...",
